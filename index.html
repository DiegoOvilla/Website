            8/21-8/23 - This is my first journal entry
        </p>So far I'm enjoying the class, the teacher and my classmates are cool. The teacher. is really chill. What I've learned so far is basically 
        where I'm typing and how to access the things I need to do my work. I want a good grade in the class so I don't know if the class will be 
        easy or hard, I guess I'll have to find out. Today we went outside to do an activity that consisted of rolling a marble across pvc pipe and 
        see which team got the furthest. Although I'm not totally sure I wanna do this class for an entire year.
