         <center> 8/20/23 - This is my first journal entry</center>   
        </p>So far im enjoying the class, the teacher and my classmates are cool. The teach. is really chill. What ive leaned so far is basically 
        where im typing and how to access the things I need to do my work. I want a good grade in the class so I dont know if the class will be 
        easy or hard, I guess ill have to find out. Today we went outside to do an activity that consisted of rolling a marble across pvc pipe and 
        see which team got the furthest. Although Im not toltally sure I wanna do this class for an entire year.

            <center>8/28-8/31 - This is my second journal entry</center> 
        </p>Im starting to like the class more and the things we do. Im still not completly sure I want to do the for my entire Freshman year 
        but I guess I just have to get more used to the class. So far it seems really fun. This week we worked on a Home appliance. For my 
        appliance I did an xbox but I turned out to be harder than i expected. I was going to do a bed becuase I enjoy sleeping but its ok, it 
        turned out pretty decent.

           <center> 9/5/23-9/8/23 - Third Jounal entry</center>  
        </p>This week we learned and worked on a Rube Goldberg mahcine for a later project we got going on. This project consist of our group 
        to make a desing out of cardboard and a baseball. But the ideas we had in mind didnt really turn out how I expected them to. We stared
        to make some ideas and desins but the two people next to me kinda just went their own way and Dixon and I kinda just went along with
        it. This was just like ideas tho and we werent sure if it was going to stay like that for the final result. We also did a worksheet
        that talked more about the mechanisms but it was pretty boring and I missed some of the questions but understood most of it.
