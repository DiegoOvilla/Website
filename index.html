         <center> 8/20/23 - This is my First Journal Entry</center>   
        </p>So far im enjoying the class, the teacher and my classmates are cool. The teach. is really chill. What ive leaned so far is basically 
        where im typing and how to access the things I need to do my work. I want a good grade in the class so I dont know if the class will be 
        easy or hard, I guess ill have to find out. Today we went outside to do an activity that consisted of rolling a marble across pvc pipe and 
        see which team got the furthest. Although Im not toltally sure I wanna do this class for an entire year.

            <center>8/28 - 8/31 - This is my second journal Entry</center> 
        </p>Im starting to like the class more and the things we do. Im still not completly sure I want to do the for my entire Freshman year 
        but I guess I just have to get more used to the class. So far it seems really fun. This week we worked on a Home appliance. For my 
        appliance I did an xbox but I turned out to be harder than i expected. I was going to do a bed becuase I enjoy sleeping but its ok, it 
        turned out pretty decent.

           <center> 9/5/23 - 9/8/23 - Third Jounal Entry</center>  
        </p>This week we learned and worked on a Rube Goldberg mahcine for a later project we got going on. This project consist of our group 
        to make a desing out of cardboard and a baseball. But the ideas we had in mind didnt really turn out how I expected them to. We stared
        to make some ideas and desins but the two people next to me kinda just went their own way and Dixon and I kinda just went along with
        it. This was just like ideas tho and we werent sure if it was going to stay like that for the final result. We also did a worksheet
        that talked more about the mechanisms but it was pretty boring and I missed some of the questions but understood most of it.

            <center> 9/11/23 - 9/15/23 Fourth Jornal Entry</center>
        </p>This week we started on the acutall Rube Goldburg Project but it was harder that it seems. The two people next to me did all of the 
        measurements and Dixon and I did a lot of cutting. We didnt really get to much done but some parts becuase the team worked kinda slow.
        So turns out that we did actually go based off of what the two people started with and just added on but I didnt really like the desing
        becase it looked to simple and easy to build with no effort put into it. When we did finsish putting everything together it didnt work.
        I kept trying to tell the guy which I think he name is Cadien or Kien or maybe even Kiedance. I dont know but I kept trying to tell 
        him that I wasnt going to work becuase the car platform was to small and the car kept falling off. But he had a additude and would 
        keep saying "but it works" so I just left and let dixon throw the ball. It eventually worked because he finally fixed something that was
        worng at the every end. It finally popped the ballon and it was over with.

            <center>9/18/23 - 9/22/23 Fifth Journal Entry </center>
        </p>We started off the week with a little bit of fun making a floatation device that had to survive 5 minutes on water. Mine was clever
        because I made an air bag that looked very simalar to a small popcorn bag. So when I did finish and it was time to go outside and try 
        it out but I noticed some last minute things I had to fix or my "boat" wouldnt work. Eventually I ended up lasting all 5 minutes and so I 
        was really happy it did work. The next project we worked on was the paper E where we had to make and E with dimensions and trade it with 
        other people in the class. It was fun the cut out and to overall a sort of relaxing activiy. It was also funny becuase Dixon had to 
        make a giant one but it wasnt even the correct mesurements. Lastly we did a computer engineerring worksheet that would help us with 
        a test/quiz we were going to take next week.

            <center>9/25/23 - 9/29/23 Sixth Journal Entry </center>
        </P>These past few weeks have been fun and im starting to really enjoy the class a bit more. This week was very different though.    
        We got to open up a computer and "dissect" it. Me and Dixon had fun doing this becuase towards the end of our dissect progress he 
        accidently dropped the screw and I started to freak out because we obviously needed them. So we started to look everywhere for them
        untill Dixon realized that we had them all and were looking for nothing becuase there werer 4 screws that came out with the object 
        itself so we laughed it off and continued with our work. The next day that we had the class we had to work on coloring sheets so that 
        we could kinda self study for the test we had. But overall the week was really fun and I would like to do more activities like this so
        I can learn more about technology itself.

            <center>10/2/23 - 10/6/23 Seventh Journal Entry </center>
        </p>So we started a new topic and its about prosthetics and how they are made, used, etc. Our assingment was to make a prosthetic hand
        out of cardboard, string, and tape and our objective was to pick up a water boltle with our arm. This was hard to make because we saw
        that the string would get in the way of the fingers so it wouldnt work like we wanted it to but towards the end of the period I realized
        that I could take off a small thin layer of the cardboard and slap in on top of the hand so that I wouldnt interfeer with the string and
        the water boltle. We got it to work right as the bell was about to ring and Im pretty sure we got a good grade. The day after that we 
        worked on Tinker Cad and now our new assingment was to create another prosthetic of any animal and how it would be attatched to it. 
        I choose a dolphin because it was more on the simple side but also on the hard side becuase my plan is to make it so that I wraps around
        the dolphin. Its due on Monday of next week and Im really confused or stuck I would say becuase using tinker cad is hard and we are only
        allowed to use the shapes that they provide for us.

            <center>10/9/23 - 10/13/23 Eight Journal Entry </center>
        </p>This week I wasnt really there but I did get to be there for the areospace video and notes but I think the new lesson will be cool
        and intresting because I like planes and when I focus really well I can make cool stuff. Our next project is to build a rocket out of 
        a coke bottle and make it fly as far as possible. My partner did the tinker cad but his desing is reallt weird becuase its basically 
        just a giant triangle on top of the bottle so I dont really like it and might just go freestyle while doing the project.
