         <center> 8/20/23 - This is my First Journal Entry</center>   
        </p>So far im enjoying the class, the teacher and my classmates are cool. The teach. is really chill. What ive leaned so far is basically 
        where im typing and how to access the things I need to do my work. I want a good grade in the class so I dont know if the class will be 
        easy or hard, I guess ill have to find out. Today we went outside to do an activity that consisted of rolling a marble across pvc pipe and 
        see which team got the furthest. Although Im not toltally sure I wanna do this class for an entire year.

            <center>8/28 - 8/31 - This is my second journal Entry</center> 
        </p>Im starting to like the class more and the things we do. Im still not completly sure I want to do the for my entire Freshman year 
        but I guess I just have to get more used to the class. So far it seems really fun. This week we worked on a Home appliance. For my 
        appliance I did an xbox but I turned out to be harder than i expected. I was going to do a bed becuase I enjoy sleeping but its ok, it 
        turned out pretty decent.

        </p>This week we learned and worked on a Rube Goldberg mahcine for a later project we got going on. This project consist of our group 
        to make a desing out of cardboard and a baseball. But the ideas we had in mind didnt really turn out how I expected them to. We stared
        to make some ideas and desins but the two people next to me kinda just went their own way and Dixon and I kinda just went along with
        it. This was just like ideas tho and we werent sure if it was going to stay like that for the final result. We also did a worksheet
        that talked more about the mechanisms but it was pretty boring and I missed some of the questions but understood most of it.

            <center> 9/11/23 - 9/15/23 Fourth Jornal Entry</center>
        </p>This week we started on the acutall Rube Goldburg Project but it was harder that it seems. The two people next to me did all of the 
        measurements and Dixon and I did a lot of cutting. We didnt really get to much done but some parts becuase the team worked kinda slow.
        So turns out that we did actually go based off of what the two people started with and just added on but I didnt really like the desing
        becase it looked to simple and easy to build with no effort put into it. When we did finsish putting everything together it didnt work.
        I kept trying to tell the guy which I think he name is Cadien or Kien or maybe even Kiedance. I dont know but I kept trying to tell 
        him that I wasnt going to work becuase the car platform was to small and the car kept falling off. But he had a additude and would 
        keep saying "but it works" so I just left and let dixon throw the ball. It eventually worked because he finally fixed something that was
        worng at the every end. It finally popped the ballon and it was over with.

            <center>9/18/23 - 9/22/23 Fifth Journal Entry </center>
        </p>We started off the week with a little bit of fun making a floatation device that had to survive 5 minutes on water. Mine was clever
        because I made an air bag that looked very simalar to a small popcorn bag. So when I did finish and it was time to go outside and try 
        it out I noticed some last minute things I had to fix or my "boat" wouldnt work. Eventually I ended up lasting all 5 minutes and so I 
        was really happy I did work. The nect project we worked on was the paper E where we had to
