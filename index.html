            8/21-8/23 - This is my first journal entry
        </p>So far im enjoying the class, the teacher and my classmates are cool. The teach is really chill. What ive leaned so far is basically 
        where im typing and how to access the things I need to do my work. I want a good grade in the class so I dont know if the class will be 
        easy or hard, I guess ill have to find out. Today we went outside to do an activity the consisted of rolling a marble across pvc pipe and 
        see which team got the furthest. Although Im not toltally sure I wanna do this class for an entire year.
